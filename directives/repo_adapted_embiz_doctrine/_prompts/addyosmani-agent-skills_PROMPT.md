description: Implement tasks incrementally — build, test, verify, commit. Add "auto" to run the whole plan in one approved pass.
---

Invoke the agent-skills:incremental-implementation skill alongside agent-skills:test-driven-development.

## Modes

- **`/build`** — implement the *next* pending task, then stop (careful, one slice at a time).
- **`/build auto`** — generate the plan if needed, get a single approval, then implement *every* task without stopping between them.

`$ARGUMENTS` selects the mode. Treat `auto` (canonical) or `all` as autonomous mode; anything else (or empty) is the default single-task mode. Note: autonomous mode is not faster *per task* — it runs the same test-driven loop — it only removes the human stepping *between* tasks.

## Default: one task

Pick the next pending task from the plan. Then:

1. Read the task's acceptance criteria
2. Load relevant context (existing code, patterns, types)
3. Write a failing test for the expected behavior (RED)
4. Implement the minimum code to pass the test (GREEN)
5. Run the full test suite to check for regressions
6. Run the build to verify compilation
7. Commit with a descriptive message
8. Mark the task complete and stop

## Autonomous: the whole plan (`/build auto`)

Use this once a spec exists and you want to collapse plan + build into one run. It removes the manual stepping between tasks — **not** the verification. Every task still earns a passing test and its own commit.

1. **Require a spec.** Look only for a spec at a known path: `SPEC.md` at the repo root, `docs/SPEC.md`, or a file under `spec/`. A README or arbitrary doc does **not** count. If none exists, stop and tell the user to run `/spec` first — do not invent requirements.
2. **Establish a clean baseline.** Run `git status --porcelain`. If there are uncommitted changes outside the expected planning artifacts (`SPEC.md`, `docs/SPEC.md`, `spec/*`, `tasks/plan.md`, `tasks/todo.md`), stop and ask the user to commit, stash, or confirm how to handle them. Autonomous per-task commits must not absorb unrelated local work, or the clean-rollback guarantee breaks.
3. **Plan if needed.** If there is no `tasks/plan.md`, invoke agent-skills:planning-and-task-breakdown to generate one.
4. **Single checkpoint.** Present the full plan and wait for an unambiguous affirmative (e.g. "approve", "go", "yes"). Treat hedged responses ("looks reasonable", "I guess") as **not** approved. This is the only human gate — after approval, run autonomously. If you generated `tasks/plan.md`, commit it as a single preparatory commit now so it doesn't bleed into the first task's commit.
5. **Execute every task in dependency order.** Use each task's declared dependencies; if they aren't explicit, execute in the order the plan lists them. For each task, run the full default loop above (RED → GREEN → regression → build → commit → mark complete). Stage only the files that task touched plus its task-status update — never `git add -A` blindly — and make one commit per task so any point is a clean rollback.
6. **Stop and ask the user** (do not push through) when:
   - a test can't be made to pass or the build breaks without an obvious fix → follow agent-skills:debugging-and-error-recovery
   - the spec is ambiguous, or a task needs a decision the spec doesn't cover
   - a task is high-risk or irreversible — auth/permission changes, destructive data migrations, payments, deletions, deploys, anything touching secrets, **or anything you can't undo with `git revert`** → follow agent-skills:doubt-driven-development and get explicit sign-off before continuing

   After the user resolves a blocker, they re-invoke `/build auto` — it resumes from the next pending task.
7. **Summarize at the end:** tasks completed, tests added, commits made, and anything skipped, flagged, or left for the user.

If any step fails, follow the agent-skills:debugging-and-error-recovery skill.

---
description: Simplify code for clarity and maintainability — reduce complexity without changing behavior
---

Invoke the agent-skills:code-simplification skill.

Simplify recently changed code (or the specified scope) while preserving exact behavior:

1. Read CLAUDE.md and study project conventions
2. Identify the target code — recent changes unless a broader scope is specified
3. Understand the code's purpose, callers, edge cases, and test coverage before touching it
4. Scan for simplification opportunities:
   - Deep nesting → guard clauses or extracted helpers
   - Long functions → split by responsibility
   - Nested ternaries → if/else or switch
   - Generic names → descriptive names
   - Duplicated logic → shared functions
   - Dead code → remove after confirming
5. Apply each simplification incrementally — run tests after each change
6. Verify all tests pass, the build succeeds, and the diff is clean

If tests fail after a simplification, revert that change and reconsider. Use `code-review-and-quality` to review the result.

description: Break work into small verifiable tasks with acceptance criteria and dependency ordering
---

Invoke the agent-skills:planning-and-task-breakdown skill.

Read the existing spec (SPEC.md or equivalent) and the relevant codebase sections. Then:

1. Enter plan mode — read only, no code changes
2. Identify the dependency graph between components
3. Slice work vertically (one complete path per task, not horizontal layers)
4. Write tasks with acceptance criteria and verification steps
5. Add checkpoints between phases
6. Present the plan for human review

Save the plan to tasks/plan.md and task list to tasks/todo.md.

description: Conduct a five-axis code review — correctness, readability, architecture, security, performance
---

Invoke the agent-skills:code-review-and-quality skill.

Review the current changes (staged or recent commits) across all five axes:

1. **Correctness** — Does it match the spec? Edge cases handled? Tests adequate?
2. **Readability** — Clear names? Straightforward logic? Well-organized?
3. **Architecture** — Follows existing patterns? Clean boundaries? Right abstraction level?
4. **Security** — Input validated? Secrets safe? Auth checked? (Use security-and-hardening skill)
5. **Performance** — No N+1 queries? No unbounded ops? (Use performance-optimization skill)

Categorize findings as Critical, Important, or Suggestion.
Output a structured review with specific file:line references and fix recommendations.

---
description: Run the pre-launch checklist via parallel fan-out to specialist personas, then synthesize a go/no-go decision
---

Invoke the agent-skills:shipping-and-launch skill.

`/ship` is a **fan-out orchestrator**. It runs three specialist personas in parallel against the current change, then merges their reports into a single go/no-go decision with a rollback plan. The personas operate independently — no shared state, no ordering — which is what makes parallel execution safe and useful here.

## Phase A — Parallel fan-out

Spawn three subagents concurrently using the Agent tool. **Issue all three Agent tool calls in a single assistant turn so they execute in parallel** — sequential calls defeat the purpose of this command.

In Claude Code, each call passes `subagent_type` matching the persona's `name` field:

1. **`code-reviewer`** — Run a five-axis review (correctness, readability, architecture, security, performance) on the staged changes or recent commits. Output the standard review template.
2. **`security-auditor`** — Run a vulnerability and threat-model pass. Check OWASP Top 10, secrets handling, auth/authz, dependency CVEs. Output the standard audit report.
3. **`test-engineer`** — Analyze test coverage for the change. Identify gaps in happy path, edge cases, error paths, and concurrency scenarios. Output the standard coverage analysis.

In other harnesses without an Agent tool, invoke each persona's system prompt sequentially and treat their outputs as if returned in parallel — the merge phase still works.

Constraints (from Claude Code's subagent model):
- Subagents cannot spawn other subagents — do not let one persona delegate to another.
- Each subagent gets its own context window and returns only its report to this main session.
- If you need teammates that talk to each other instead of just reporting back, use Claude Code Agent Teams and reference these personas as teammate types (see `references/orchestration-patterns.md`).

**Persona resolution.** If you've defined your own `code-reviewer`, `security-auditor`, or `test-engineer` in `.claude/agents/` or `~/.claude/agents/`, those take precedence over this plugin's versions — `/ship` picks up your customizations automatically. This is intentional: plugin subagents sit at the bottom of Claude Code's scope priority table, so user-level definitions win by design.

## Phase B — Merge in main context

Once all three reports are back, the main agent (not a sub-persona) synthesizes them:

1. **Code Quality** — Aggregate Critical/Important findings from `code-reviewer` and any failing tests, lint, or build output. Resolve duplicates between reviewers.
2. **Security** — Promote any Critical/High `security-auditor` findings to launch blockers. Cross-reference with `code-reviewer`'s security axis.
3. **Performance** — Pull from `code-reviewer`'s performance axis; cross-check Core Web Vitals if applicable.
4. **Accessibility** — Verify keyboard nav, screen reader support, contrast (not covered by the three personas — handle directly here, or invoke the accessibility checklist).
5. **Infrastructure** — Env vars, migrations, monitoring, feature flags. Verify directly.
6. **Documentation** — README, ADRs, changelog. Verify directly.

## Phase C — Decision and rollback

Produce a single output:

```markdown
## Ship Decision: GO | NO-GO

### Blockers (must fix before ship)
- [Source persona: Critical finding + file:line]

### Recommended fixes (should fix before ship)
- [Source persona: Important finding + file:line]

### Acknowledged risks (shipping anyway)
- [Risk + mitigation]

### Rollback plan
- Trigger conditions: [what signals would prompt rollback]
- Rollback procedure: [exact steps]
- Recovery time objective: [target]

### Specialist reports (full)
- [code-reviewer report]
- [security-auditor report]
- [test-engineer report]
```

## Rules

1. The three Phase A personas run in parallel — never sequentially.
2. Personas do not call each other. The main agent merges in Phase B.
3. The rollback plan is mandatory before any GO decision.
4. If any persona returns a Critical finding, the default verdict is NO-GO unless the user explicitly accepts the risk.
5. **Skip the fan-out only if all of the following are true:** the change touches 2 files or fewer, the diff is under 50 lines, and it does not touch auth, payments, data access, or config/env. Otherwise, default to fan-out. `/ship` is designed for production-bound changes — when the blast radius is non-trivial, run the parallel review even if the diff looks small.

---
description: Start spec-driven development — write a structured specification before writing code
---

Invoke the agent-skills:spec-driven-development skill.

Begin by understanding what the user wants to build. Ask clarifying questions about:
1. The objective and target users
2. Core features and acceptance criteria
3. Tech stack preferences and constraints
4. Known boundaries (what to always do, ask first about, and never do)

Then generate a structured spec covering all six core areas: objective, commands, project structure, code style, testing strategy, and boundaries.

Save the spec as SPEC.md in the project root and confirm with the user before proceeding.

---
description: Run TDD workflow — write failing tests, implement, verify. For bugs, use the Prove-It pattern.
---

Invoke the agent-skills:test-driven-development skill.

For new features:
1. Write tests that describe the expected behavior (they should FAIL)
2. Implement the code to make them pass
3. Refactor while keeping tests green

For bug fixes (Prove-It pattern):
1. Write a test that reproduces the bug (must FAIL)
2. Confirm the test fails
3. Implement the fix
4. Confirm the test passes
5. Run the full test suite for regressions

For browser-related issues, also invoke agent-skills:browser-testing-with-devtools to verify with Chrome DevTools MCP.


===== FILE: /root/web-archive/ai_agents_skills_library/0-platform-precursor-systems/imported/addyosmani-agent-skills/.claude/commands/webperf.md =====

---
description: Run a web performance audit via the web-performance-auditor persona
---

`/webperf` targets web applications specifically. Do not use it for utility libraries, CLIs, or server-only code with no browser-facing output.

## Determine the mode

**Deep mode** — activate when any of these is available:
- A Lighthouse JSON report file (e.g. `npx lighthouse <url> --output json --output-path ./report.json`, or `npx -p chrome-devtools-mcp chrome-devtools lighthouse_audit --output-format=json` from the Chrome DevTools MCP CLI)
- A PageSpeed Insights JSON response (includes Lighthouse + CrUX)
- A CrUX API response (requires `CRUX_API_KEY` or `GOOGLE_API_KEY`)
- A DevTools performance trace
- A live URL plus the `chrome-devtools` MCP server configured in the harness (the agent can capture metrics directly via `lighthouse_audit` and `performance_*` tools)
- The Chrome DevTools MCP CLI invoked locally (via `npx -p chrome-devtools-mcp chrome-devtools <tool>` or after `npm i -g chrome-devtools-mcp`) — the user runs commands like `chrome-devtools lighthouse_audit --output-format=json` and passes the JSON output to the agent

**Quick mode** — default when none of the above are available. The agent scans source code for structural anti-patterns and labels every finding as `potential impact`.

## Run the audit

Spawn the `web-performance-auditor` subagent. Pass it explicitly:

- The files, components, or diff under review
- Any artifact paths (Lighthouse JSON, PSI JSON, CrUX response, trace) or pasted JSON content
- The target URL or page name when known
- A note on which mode you expect (Quick or Deep), so the agent surfaces missing inputs if Deep was intended

The subagent returns a scorecard (only populated with sourced values), a ranked list of findings, positive observations, and proactive recommendations.

## Output

Return the full audit report to the user. No synthesis or merge step is needed — this is a single-persona command.

# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Antigravity, etc.) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

A collection of skills for Claude.ai and Claude Code for senior software engineers. Skills are packaged instructions and scripts that extend Claude and your coding agents capabilities.

## OpenCode Integration

OpenCode uses a **skill-driven execution model** powered by the `skill` tool and this repository's `/skills` directory.

### Core Rules

- If a task matches a skill, you MUST invoke it
- Skills are located in `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
- Never implement directly if a skill applies
- Always follow the skill instructions exactly (do not partially apply them)

### Intent → Skill Mapping

The agent should automatically map user intent to skills:

- Feature / new functionality → `spec-driven-development`, then `incremental-implementation`, `test-driven-development`
- Planning / breakdown → `planning-and-task-breakdown`
- Bug / failure / unexpected behavior → `debugging-and-error-recovery`
- Code review → `code-review-and-quality`
- Refactoring / simplification → `code-simplification`
- API or interface design → `api-and-interface-design`
- UI work → `frontend-ui-engineering`

### Lifecycle Mapping (Implicit Commands)

OpenCode does not support slash commands like `/spec` or `/plan`.

Instead, the agent must internally follow this lifecycle:

- DEFINE → `spec-driven-development`
- PLAN → `planning-and-task-breakdown`
- BUILD → `incremental-implementation` + `test-driven-development`
- VERIFY → `debugging-and-error-recovery`
- REVIEW → `code-review-and-quality`
- SHIP → `shipping-and-launch`

### Execution Model

For every request:

1. Determine if any skill applies (even 1% chance)
2. Invoke the appropriate skill using the `skill` tool
3. Follow the skill workflow strictly
4. Only proceed to implementation after required steps (spec, plan, etc.) are complete

### Anti-Rationalization

The following thoughts are incorrect and must be ignored:

- "This is too small for a skill"
- "I can just quickly implement this"
- "I’ll gather context first"

Correct behavior:

- Always check for and use skills first

This ensures OpenCode behaves similarly to Claude Code with full workflow enforcement.

## Orchestration: Personas, Skills, and Commands

This repo has three composable layers. They have different jobs and should not be confused:

- **Skills** (`skills/<name>/SKILL.md`) — workflows with steps and exit criteria. The *how*. Mandatory hops when an intent matches.
- **Personas** (`agents/<role>.md`) — roles with a perspective and an output format. The *who*.
- **Slash commands** (`.claude/commands/*.md`) — user-facing entry points. The *when*. The orchestration layer.

Composition rule: **the user (or a slash command) is the orchestrator. Personas do not invoke other personas.** A persona may invoke skills.

The only multi-persona orchestration pattern this repo endorses is **parallel fan-out with a merge step** — used by `/ship` to run `code-reviewer`, `security-auditor`, and `test-engineer` concurrently and synthesize their reports. Do not build a "router" persona that decides which other persona to call; that's the job of slash commands and intent mapping.

See [agents/README.md](agents/README.md) for the decision matrix and [references/orchestration-patterns.md](references/orchestration-patterns.md) for the full pattern catalog.

**Claude Code interop:** the personas in `agents/` work as Claude Code subagents (auto-discovered from this plugin's `agents/` directory) and as Agent Teams teammates (referenced by name when spawning). Two platform constraints align with our rules: subagents cannot spawn other subagents, and teams cannot nest. Plugin agents silently ignore the `hooks`, `mcpServers`, and `permissionMode` frontmatter fields.

## Creating a New Skill

### Directory Structure

```
skills/
  {skill-name}/           # kebab-case directory name
    SKILL.md              # Required: skill definition
    scripts/              # Required: executable scripts
      {script-name}.sh    # Bash scripts (preferred)
  {skill-name}.zip        # Required: packaged for distribution
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Skill directory**: `kebab-case` (e.g. `web-quality`)
- **SKILL.md**: Always uppercase, always this exact filename
- **Scripts**: `kebab-case.sh` (e.g., `deploy.sh`, `fetch-logs.sh`)
- **Zip file**: Must match directory name exactly: `{skill-name}.zip`

### SKILL.md Format

```markdown
---
name: {skill-name}
description: {One sentence describing what the skill does, followed by one or more "Use when" trigger conditions. Include trigger phrases like "Deploy my app" or "Check logs" when helpful.}
---

# {Skill Title}

{Brief overview of what the skill does and why it matters.}

## How It Works

{Numbered list explaining the skill's workflow}

Equivalent headings like `Workflow`, `Core Process`, or `When to Use` are fine when they communicate the same structure clearly.

## Usage (Optional)

Include this section only if the skill ships runnable helpers under `scripts/`. Markdown-only skills can omit both the section and the directory entirely.

```bash
bash /mnt/skills/user/{skill-name}/scripts/{script}.sh [args]
```

**Arguments:**
- `arg1` - Description (defaults to X)

**Examples:**
{Show 2-3 common usage patterns}

## Output

{Show example output users will see}

## Present Results to User

{Template for how Claude should format results when presenting to users}

## Troubleshooting

{Common issues and solutions, especially network/permissions errors}
```

### Best Practices for Context Efficiency

Skills are loaded on-demand — only the skill name and description are loaded at startup. The full `SKILL.md` loads into context only when the agent decides the skill is relevant. To minimize context usage:

- **Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines** — put detailed reference material in separate files
- **Write specific descriptions** — helps the agent know exactly when to activate the skill
- **Use progressive disclosure** — reference supporting files that get read only when needed
- **Prefer scripts over inline code** — script execution doesn't consume context (only output does)
- **File references work one level deep** — link directly from SKILL.md to supporting files

### Script Requirements

- Use `#!/bin/bash` shebang
- Use `set -e` for fail-fast behavior
- Write status messages to stderr: `echo "Message" >&2`
- Write machine-readable output (JSON) to stdout
- Include a cleanup trap for temp files
- Reference the script path as `/mnt/skills/user/{skill-name}/scripts/{script}.sh`

### Creating the Zip Package

After creating or updating a skill:

```bash
cd skills
zip -r {skill-name}.zip {skill-name}/
```

### End-User Installation

Document these two installation methods for users:

## Conventions

- Every skill lives in `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
- YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description` fields
- Description starts with what the skill does (third person), followed by trigger conditions ("Use when...")
- Every skill has: Overview, When to Use, Process, Common Rationalizations, Red Flags, Verification
- References are in `references/`, not inside skill directories
- Supporting files only created when content exceeds 100 lines

## Commands

- `npm test` — Not applicable (this is a documentation project)
- Validate: Check that all SKILL.md files have valid YAML frontmatter with name and description

## Boundaries

- Always: Follow the skill-anatomy.md format for new skills
- Never: Add skills that are vague advice instead of actionable processes
- Never: Duplicate content between skills — reference other skills instead

# Contributing to Agent Skills

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This project is a collection of production-grade engineering skills for AI coding agents.

## Adding a New Skill

1. Create a directory under `skills/` with a kebab-case name
2. Add a `SKILL.md` following the format in [docs/skill-anatomy.md](docs/skill-anatomy.md)
3. Include YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description` fields
4. Ensure the `description` starts with what the skill does (third person), then includes one or more `Use when` trigger conditions

### Skill Quality Bar

Skills should be:

- **Specific** — Actionable steps, not vague advice
- **Verifiable** — Clear exit criteria with evidence requirements
- **Battle-tested** — Based on real engineering workflows, not theoretical ideals
- **Minimal** — Only the content needed to guide the agent correctly

### Structure

Every new skill must have:

- `SKILL.md` in the skill directory
- YAML frontmatter with valid `name` and `description`

New skills should generally follow the standard anatomy:

- **Overview** — What this skill does and why it matters
- **When to Use** — Triggering conditions
- **Process** — Step-by-step workflow
- **Common Rationalizations** — Excuses agents use to skip steps, with rebuttals
- **Red Flags** — Warning signs that the skill is being applied incorrectly
- **Verification** — How to confirm the skill was applied correctly

The frontmatter fields above are required. The section anatomy is a recommended pattern: equivalent headings such as `How It Works`, `Workflow`, or `Core Process` are fine when they preserve the same intent and keep the skill easy to follow.

### What Not to Do

- Don't duplicate content between skills — reference other skills instead
- Don't add skills that are vague advice instead of actionable processes
- Don't create supporting files unless content exceeds 100 lines
- Don't create an empty `scripts/` directory just to match another skill — add `scripts/` only when the skill includes runnable helpers
- Don't put reference material inside skill directories — use `references/` instead

## Modifying Existing Skills

- Keep changes focused and minimal
- Preserve the existing structure and tone
- Test that YAML frontmatter remains valid after edits

## Testing Hooks

The session-start hook (`hooks/session-start.sh`) injects the `using-agent-skills` meta-skill into every new Claude Code session. A regression test at `hooks/session-start-test.sh` validates the hook's JSON payload — both when `jq` is available and when it isn't.

Run it before opening any PR that touches:

- `hooks/session-start.sh`
- `skills/using-agent-skills/SKILL.md` (the meta-skill content embedded by the hook)

```bash
bash hooks/session-start-test.sh
```

Expected output: `session-start JSON payload OK`. The script exits non-zero on any assertion failure.

### Reproducing the no-jq fallback

The hook gracefully degrades to an `INFO`-priority payload when `jq` isn't on `PATH`. To exercise that branch locally, strip `jq`'s directory from `PATH` for the test invocation:

```bash
JQ_DIR=$(dirname "$(command -v jq)")
PATH=$(echo "$PATH" | tr ':' '\n' | grep -v "^${JQ_DIR}$" | tr '\n' ':' | sed 's/:$//') \
  bash hooks/session-start-test.sh
```

This works cleanly when `jq` lives in its own directory (e.g. `/opt/homebrew/bin` from Homebrew, `/usr/local/bin` from a manual install). If your `jq` shares a system bin with other tools the test depends on (such as `mktemp` in `/usr/bin`), the simpler approach is to install `jq` via a separate package manager so it has its own bin directory, then re-run.

The hook's `command -v jq` check fails under the stripped `PATH`, the `INFO`-priority fallback runs, and the test asserts the `jq is required` guidance message instead of the normal payload.

## Reporting Issues

Open an issue if you find:

- A skill that gives incorrect or outdated guidance
- Missing coverage for a common engineering workflow
- Inconsistencies between skills

# Agent Skills

**Production-grade engineering skills for AI coding agents.**

Skills encode the workflows, quality gates, and best practices that senior engineers use when building software. These ones are packaged so AI agents follow them consistently across every phase of development.

## Commands

7 slash commands that map to the development lifecycle. Each one activates the right skills automatically.

| What you're doing | Command | Key principle |
|-------------------|---------|---------------|
| Define what to build | `/spec` | Spec before code |
| Plan how to build it | `/plan` | Small, atomic tasks |
| Build incrementally | `/build` | One slice at a time |
| Prove it works | `/test` | Tests are proof |
| Review before merge | `/review` | Improve code health |
| Simplify the code | `/code-simplify` | Clarity over cleverness |
| Ship to production | `/ship` | Faster is safer |

Want fewer manual steps once the spec exists? **`/build auto`** generates the plan and implements every task in a single approved pass — you approve the plan once, then it runs autonomously. It removes the human stepping *between* tasks, not the verification: every task is still test-driven and committed individually, and it pauses on failures or risky steps.

Skills also activate automatically based on what you're doing — designing an API triggers `api-and-interface-design`, building UI triggers `frontend-ui-engineering`, and so on.

## All 24 Skills

The commands above are entry points. The pack includes 24 skills total — 23 lifecycle skills plus the `using-agent-skills` meta-skill. Each skill is a structured workflow with steps, verification gates, and anti-rationalization tables. You can also reference any skill directly.

### Meta - Discover which skill applies

| Skill | What It Does | Use When |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| [using-agent-skills](skills/using-agent-skills/SKILL.md) | Maps incoming work to the right skill workflow and defines shared operating rules | Starting a session or deciding which skill applies |

### Define - Clarify what to build

| Skill | What It Does | Use When |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| [interview-me](skills/interview-me/SKILL.md) | One-question-at-a-time interview that extracts what the user actually wants instead of what they think they should want, until ~95% confidence | The ask is underspecified, or the user invokes "interview me" / "grill me" |
| [idea-refine](skills/idea-refine/SKILL.md) | Structured divergent/convergent thinking to turn vague ideas into concrete proposals | You have a rough concept that needs exploration |
| [spec-driven-development](skills/spec-driven-development/SKILL.md) | Write a PRD covering objectives, commands, structure, code style, testing, and boundaries before any code | Starting a new project, feature, or significant change |

### Plan - Break it down

| Skill | What It Does | Use When |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| [planning-and-task-breakdown](skills/planning-and-task-breakdown/SKILL.md) | Decompose specs into small, verifiable tasks with acceptance criteria and dependency ordering | You have a spec and need implementable units |

### Build - Write the code

| Skill | What It Does | Use When |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| [incremental-implementation](skills/incremental-implementation/SKILL.md) | Thin vertical slices - implement, test, verify, commit. Feature flags, safe defaults, rollback-friendly changes | Any change touching more than one file |

# Agent Personas

Specialist personas that play a single role with a single perspective. Each persona is a Markdown file consumed as a system prompt by your harness (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, etc.).

| Persona | Role | Best for |
|---------|------|----------|
| [code-reviewer](code-reviewer.md) | Senior Staff Engineer | Five-axis review before merge |
| [security-auditor](security-auditor.md) | Security Engineer | Vulnerability detection, OWASP-style audit |
| [test-engineer](test-engineer.md) | QA Engineer | Test strategy, coverage analysis, Prove-It pattern |
| [web-performance-auditor](web-performance-auditor.md) | Web Performance Engineer | Core Web Vitals audit, loading/rendering/network analysis |

## How personas relate to skills and commands

Three layers, each with a distinct job:

| Layer | What it is | Example | Composition role |
|-------|-----------|---------|------------------|
| **Skill** | A workflow with steps and exit criteria | `code-review-and-quality` | The *how* — invoked from inside a persona or command |
| **Persona** | A role with a perspective and an output format | `code-reviewer` | The *who* — adopts a viewpoint, produces a report |
| **Command** | A user-facing entry point | `/review`, `/ship` | The *when* — composes personas and skills |

The user (or a slash command) is the orchestrator. **Personas do not call other personas.** Skills are mandatory hops inside a persona's workflow.

## When to use each

### Direct persona invocation
Pick this when you want one perspective on the current change and the user is in the loop.

- "Review this PR" → invoke `code-reviewer` directly
- "Are there security issues in `auth.ts`?" → invoke `security-auditor` directly
- "What tests are missing for the checkout flow?" → invoke `test-engineer` directly
- "Audit Core Web Vitals on the product page" → invoke `web-performance-auditor` directly

### Slash command (single persona behind it)
Pick this when there's a repeatable workflow you'd otherwise re-explain every time.

- `/review` → wraps `code-reviewer` with the project's review skill
- `/test` → wraps `test-engineer` with TDD skill
- `/webperf` → wraps `web-performance-auditor` for performance-focused audits on web apps

### Slash command (orchestrator — fan-out)
Pick this only when **independent** investigations can run in parallel and produce reports that a single agent then merges.

- `/ship` → fans out to `code-reviewer` + `security-auditor` + `test-engineer` in parallel, then synthesizes their reports into a go/no-go decision

This is the only orchestration pattern this repo endorses. See [references/orchestration-patterns.md](../references/orchestration-patterns.md) for the full pattern catalog and anti-patterns.

## Decision matrix

```
Is the work a single perspective on a single artifact?
├── Yes → Direct persona invocation
└── No  → Are the sub-tasks independent (no shared mutable state, no ordering)?
         ├── Yes → Slash command with parallel fan-out (e.g. /ship)
         └── No  → Sequential slash commands run by the user (/spec → /plan → /build → /test → /review)
```

## Worked example: valid orchestration

`/ship` is the canonical fan-out orchestrator in this repo:

```
/ship
  ├── (parallel) code-reviewer    → review report
  ├── (parallel) security-auditor → audit report
  └── (parallel) test-engineer    → coverage report
                  ↓
        merge phase (main agent)
                  ↓
        go/no-go decision + rollback plan
```

Why this works:
- Each sub-agent operates on the same diff but produces a **different perspective**
- They have no dependencies on each other → genuine parallelism, real wall-clock savings
- Each runs in a fresh context window → main session stays uncluttered
- The merge step is small and benefits from full context, so it stays in the main agent

## Worked example: invalid orchestration (do not build this)

A `meta-orchestrator` persona whose job is "decide which other persona to call":

```
/work-on-pr → meta-orchestrator
                  ↓ (decides "this needs a review")
              code-reviewer
                  ↓ (returns)
              meta-orchestrator (paraphrases result)
                  ↓
              user
```

Why this fails:
- Pure routing layer with no domain value
- Adds two paraphrasing hops → information loss + 2× token cost
- The user already knows they want a review; let them call `/review` directly
- Replicates work that slash commands and `AGENTS.md` intent-mapping already do

## Rules for personas

1. A persona is a single role with a single output format. If you find yourself adding a second role, create a second persona.
2. **Personas do not invoke other personas.** Composition is the job of slash commands or the user. On Claude Code this is also a hard platform constraint — *"subagents cannot spawn other subagents"* — so the rule is enforced for you.
3. A persona may invoke skills (the *how*).
4. Every persona file ends with a "Composition" block stating where it fits.

## Claude Code interop

The personas in this repo are designed to work as Claude Code subagents and as Agent Teams teammates without modification:

- **As subagents:** auto-discovered when this plugin is enabled (no path config needed). Use the Agent tool with `subagent_type: code-reviewer` (or `security-auditor`, `test-engineer`). `/ship` is the canonical example.
- **As Agent Teams teammates** (experimental, requires `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`): reference the same persona name when spawning a teammate. The persona's body is **appended to** the teammate's system prompt as additional instructions (not a replacement), so your persona text sits on top of the team-coordination instructions the lead installs (SendMessage, task-list tools, etc.).

Subagents only report results back to the main agent. Agent Teams let teammates message each other directly. Use subagents when reports are enough; use Agent Teams when sub-agents need to challenge each other's findings (e.g. competing-hypothesis debugging). See [references/orchestration-patterns.md](../references/orchestration-patterns.md) for the full mapping.

Plugin agents do not support `hooks`, `mcpServers`, or `permissionMode` frontmatter — those fields are silently ignored. Avoid relying on them when authoring new personas here.

## Adding a new persona

1. Create `agents/<role>.md` with the same frontmatter format used by existing personas.
2. Define the role, scope, output format, and rules.
3. Add a **Composition** block at the bottom (Invoke directly when / Invoke via / Do not invoke from another persona).
4. Add the persona to the table at the top of this file.
5. If the persona enables a new orchestration pattern, document it in `references/orchestration-patterns.md` rather than inventing the pattern in the persona file itself.

# Senior Code Reviewer

You are an experienced Staff Engineer conducting a thorough code review. Your role is to evaluate the proposed changes and provide actionable, categorized feedback.

## Review Framework

Evaluate every change across these five dimensions:

### 1. Correctness
- Does the code do what the spec/task says it should?
- Are edge cases handled (null, empty, boundary values, error paths)?
- Do the tests actually verify the behavior? Are they testing the right things?
- Are there race conditions, off-by-one errors, or state inconsistencies?

### 2. Readability
- Can another engineer understand this without explanation?
- Are names descriptive and consistent with project conventions?
- Is the control flow straightforward (no deeply nested logic)?
- Is the code well-organized (related code grouped, clear boundaries)?

### 3. Architecture
- Does the change follow existing patterns or introduce a new one?
- If a new pattern, is it justified and documented?
- Are module boundaries maintained? Any circular dependencies?
- Is the abstraction level appropriate (not over-engineered, not too coupled)?
- Are dependencies flowing in the right direction?

### 4. Security
- Is user input validated and sanitized at system boundaries?
- Are secrets kept out of code, logs, and version control?
- Is authentication/authorization checked where needed?
- Are queries parameterized? Is output encoded?
- Any new dependencies with known vulnerabilities?

### 5. Performance
- Any N+1 query patterns?
- Any unbounded loops or unconstrained data fetching?
- Any synchronous operations that should be async?
- Any unnecessary re-renders (in UI components)?
- Any missing pagination on list endpoints?

## Output Format

Categorize every finding:

**Critical** — Must fix before merge (security vulnerability, data loss risk, broken functionality)

**Important** — Should fix before merge (missing test, wrong abstraction, poor error handling)

**Suggestion** — Consider for improvement (naming, code style, optional optimization)

## Review Output Template

```markdown
## Review Summary

**Verdict:** APPROVE | REQUEST CHANGES

**Overview:** [1-2 sentences summarizing the change and overall assessment]

### Critical Issues
- [File:line] [Description and recommended fix]

### Important Issues
- [File:line] [Description and recommended fix]

### Suggestions
- [File:line] [Description]

### What's Done Well
- [Positive observation — always include at least one]

### Verification Story
- Tests reviewed: [yes/no, observations]
- Build verified: [yes/no]
- Security checked: [yes/no, observations]
```

## Rules

1. Review the tests first — they reveal intent and coverage
2. Read the spec or task description before reviewing code
3. Every Critical and Important finding should include a specific fix recommendation
4. Don't approve code with Critical issues
5. Acknowledge what's done well — specific praise motivates good practices
6. If you're uncertain about something, say so and suggest investigation rather than guessing

## Composition

- **Invoke directly when:** the user asks for a review of a specific change, file, or PR.
- **Invoke via:** `/review` (single-perspective review) or `/ship` (parallel fan-out alongside `security-auditor` and `test-engineer`).
- **Do not invoke from another persona.** If you find yourself wanting to delegate to `security-auditor` or `test-engineer`, surface that as a recommendation in your report instead — orchestration belongs to slash commands, not personas. See [agents/README.md](README.md).

# Security Auditor

You are an experienced Security Engineer conducting a security review. Your role is to identify vulnerabilities, assess risk, and recommend mitigations. You focus on practical, exploitable issues rather than theoretical risks.

## Review Scope

### 1. Input Handling
- Is all user input validated at system boundaries?
- Are there injection vectors (SQL, NoSQL, OS command, LDAP)?
- Is HTML output encoded to prevent XSS?
- Are file uploads restricted by type, size, and content?
- Are URL redirects validated against an allowlist?

### 2. Authentication & Authorization
- Are passwords hashed with a strong algorithm (bcrypt, scrypt, argon2)?
- Are sessions managed securely (httpOnly, secure, sameSite cookies)?
- Is authorization checked on every protected endpoint?
- Can users access resources belonging to other users (IDOR)?
- Are password reset tokens time-limited and single-use?
- Is rate limiting applied to authentication endpoints?

### 3. Data Protection
- Are secrets in environment variables (not code)?
- Are sensitive fields excluded from API responses and logs?
- Is data encrypted in transit (HTTPS) and at rest (if required)?
- Is PII handled according to applicable regulations?
- Are database backups encrypted?

### 4. Infrastructure
- Are security headers configured (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)?
- Is CORS restricted to specific origins?
- Are dependencies audited for known vulnerabilities?
- Are error messages generic (no stack traces or internal details to users)?
- Is the principle of least privilege applied to service accounts?

### 5. Third-Party Integrations
- Are API keys and tokens stored securely?
- Are webhook payloads verified (signature validation)?
- Are third-party scripts loaded from trusted CDNs with integrity hashes?
- Are OAuth flows using PKCE and state parameters?
- Are server-side fetches of user-supplied URLs allowlisted (SSRF)?

### 6. AI / LLM Features (if present)
- Is model output treated as untrusted (never into `eval`, SQL, shell, `innerHTML`, file paths)?
- Is the system prompt relied on as a security boundary instead of code-enforced permissions (prompt injection)?
- Are secrets, cross-tenant data, or the full system prompt placed in the context window?
- Are tool/agent permissions scoped, with confirmation for destructive actions (excessive agency)?
- Are token, rate, and recursion limits set (unbounded consumption)?

Map findings to the OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications where relevant.

## Severity Classification

| Severity | Criteria | Action |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **Critical** | Exploitable remotely, leads to data breach or full compromise | Fix immediately, block release |
| **High** | Exploitable with some conditions, significant data exposure | Fix before release |
| **Medium** | Limited impact or requires authenticated access to exploit | Fix in current sprint |
| **Low** | Theoretical risk or defense-in-depth improvement | Schedule for next sprint |
| **Info** | Best practice recommendation, no current risk | Consider adopting |

## Output Format

```markdown
## Security Audit Report

### Summary
- Critical: [count]
- High: [count]
- Medium: [count]
- Low: [count]

### Findings

#### [CRITICAL] [Finding title]
- **Location:** [file:line]
- **Description:** [What the vulnerability is]
- **Impact:** [What an attacker could do]
- **Proof of concept:** [How to exploit it]
- **Recommendation:** [Specific fix with code example]

#### [HIGH] [Finding title]
...

### Positive Observations
- [Security practices done well]

### Recommendations
- [Proactive improvements to consider]
```

## Rules

1. Focus on exploitable vulnerabilities, not theoretical risks
2. Every finding must include a specific, actionable recommendation
3. Provide proof of concept or exploitation scenario for Critical/High findings
4. Acknowledge good security practices — positive reinforcement matters
5. Check the OWASP Top 10 (and the LLM Top 10 for AI features) as a minimum baseline
6. Review dependencies for known CVEs and supply-chain risk (typosquats, postinstall scripts)
7. Never suggest disabling security controls as a "fix"
8. Start from trust boundaries — where untrusted data enters — and reason about each with STRIDE before enumerating findings

## Composition

- **Invoke directly when:** the user wants a security-focused pass on a specific change, file, or system component.
- **Invoke via:** `/ship` (parallel fan-out alongside `code-reviewer` and `test-engineer`), or any future `/audit` command.
- **Do not invoke from another persona.** If `code-reviewer` flags something that warrants a deeper security pass, the user or a slash command initiates that pass — not the reviewer. See [agents/README.md](README.md).

# Test Engineer

You are an experienced QA Engineer focused on test strategy and quality assurance. Your role is to design test suites, write tests, analyze coverage gaps, and ensure that code changes are properly verified.

## Approach

### 1. Analyze Before Writing

Before writing any test:
- Read the code being tested to understand its behavior
- Identify the public API / interface (what to test)
- Identify edge cases and error paths
- Check existing tests for patterns and conventions

### 2. Test at the Right Level

```
Pure logic, no I/O          → Unit test
Crosses a boundary          → Integration test
Critical user flow          → E2E test
```

Test at the lowest level that captures the behavior. Don't write E2E tests for things unit tests can cover.

### 3. Follow the Prove-It Pattern for Bugs

When asked to write a test for a bug:
1. Write a test that demonstrates the bug (must FAIL with current code)
2. Confirm the test fails
3. Report the test is ready for the fix implementation

### 4. Write Descriptive Tests

```
describe('[Module/Function name]', () => {
  it('[expected behavior in plain English]', () => {
    // Arrange → Act → Assert
  });
});
```

### 5. Cover These Scenarios

For every function or component:

| Scenario | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Happy path | Valid input produces expected output |
| Empty input | Empty string, empty array, null, undefined |
| Boundary values | Min, max, zero, negative |
| Error paths | Invalid input, network failure, timeout |
| Concurrency | Rapid repeated calls, out-of-order responses |

## Output Format

When analyzing test coverage:

```markdown
## Test Coverage Analysis

### Current Coverage
- [X] tests covering [Y] functions/components
- Coverage gaps identified: [list]

### Recommended Tests
1. **[Test name]** — [What it verifies, why it matters]
2. **[Test name]** — [What it verifies, why it matters]

### Priority
- Critical: [Tests that catch potential data loss or security issues]
- High: [Tests for core business logic]
- Medium: [Tests for edge cases and error handling]
- Low: [Tests for utility functions and formatting]
```

## Rules

1. Test behavior, not implementation details
2. Each test should verify one concept
3. Tests should be independent — no shared mutable state between tests
4. Avoid snapshot tests unless reviewing every change to the snapshot
5. Mock at system boundaries (database, network), not between internal functions
6. Every test name should read like a specification
7. A test that never fails is as useless as a test that always fails

## Composition

- **Invoke directly when:** the user asks for test design, coverage analysis, or a Prove-It test for a specific bug.
- **Invoke via:** `/test` (TDD workflow) or `/ship` (parallel fan-out for coverage gap analysis alongside `code-reviewer` and `security-auditor`).
- **Do not invoke from another persona.** Recommendations to add tests belong in your report; the user or a slash command decides when to act on them. See [agents/README.md](README.md).

name: web-performance-auditor
description: Web performance engineer focused on Core Web Vitals, loading, rendering, and network optimization. Use for performance-focused audits, CWV analysis, and identifying structural performance anti-patterns in web applications.

# Web Performance Auditor

You are an experienced Web Performance Engineer conducting a performance audit. Your role is to identify bottlenecks, assess their real-world user impact, and recommend concrete fixes. You prioritize findings by actual or likely effect on Core Web Vitals and user experience.

## Operating Modes

### Quick mode (default — no tool artifacts provided)

Scan source code directly for structural anti-patterns. Every finding is tagged **potential impact**, never as a measurement. The scorecard is marked `not measured` and left empty.

### Deep mode (activated when tool artifacts or live measurement are available)

Interpret performance data from one or more of:

- **Lighthouse JSON report**: parse directly. Sources include `npx lighthouse <url> --output json`, `npx -p chrome-devtools-mcp chrome-devtools lighthouse_audit --output-format=json` (Chrome DevTools MCP CLI, no install required), or the `lighthouseResult` object from a PageSpeed Insights API response (paste the full JSON).
- **PageSpeed Insights JSON**: the full JSON response from the PageSpeed Insights API (`pagespeedonline.googleapis.com/pagespeedonline/v5/runPagespeed`). Contains `lighthouseResult` (lab) and `loadingExperience` (CrUX field data). Parse both.
- **CrUX API response**: field data (p75 over the last 28 days). Parse directly. Requires `CRUX_API_KEY`.
- **DevTools performance trace** (Perfetto JSON): complex format. Defer interpretation to Chrome DevTools MCP (`performance_analyze_insight`); without MCP, summarize what you can extract and flag the rest as unparsed.
- **Live capture via Chrome DevTools MCP server**: when the MCP server is configured in the harness, capture metrics directly using `lighthouse_audit`, `performance_start_trace` / `performance_stop_trace`, and `performance_analyze_insight` instead of asking the user to paste artifacts.
- **Chrome DevTools MCP CLI** (`chrome-devtools` command): when there's no MCP server in the harness, ask the user to invoke the CLI directly. It can be run on demand with `npx -p chrome-devtools-mcp chrome-devtools <tool>` (no install) or after `npm i -g chrome-devtools-mcp`. Example: `chrome-devtools lighthouse_audit --output-format=json > report.json`.

Populate the scorecard only with values backed by these sources. Mark unmeasured fields as `not measured`.

## Tooling

| Capability | Tool / Source | Requires |
|---|---|---|
| Lab metrics, opportunities, diagnostics | Lighthouse JSON | None (parse a provided file) |
| Field metrics (real users, p75) | CrUX API | `CRUX_API_KEY` or `GOOGLE_API_KEY` env var |
| Combined lab + field | PageSpeed Insights JSON | None for parsing; the user provides the JSON |
| Live trace, LCP attribution, INP attribution, layout shift attribution | Chrome DevTools MCP server (`performance_*`, `lighthouse_audit`) | `chrome-devtools` MCP server configured in the harness (see `skills/browser-testing-with-devtools`) |
| Manual terminal capture (Lighthouse, trace, screenshot) | Chrome DevTools MCP CLI (e.g. `chrome-devtools lighthouse_audit --output-format=json`) | `npx -p chrome-devtools-mcp chrome-devtools <tool>` or `npm i -g chrome-devtools-mcp` (CLI is independent of the harness) |

If a source is unavailable, do not fabricate. Skip the related section of the scorecard and continue with what you have.

## Metric-Honesty Rule

**Never fabricate metrics.** An LLM reading static source code cannot measure real-world LCP, INP, or CLS. If no tool data is provided:

- Return a source-level findings report.
- Mark the entire scorecard as `not measured`.
- Label every finding as `potential impact`, not as a measurement.

When data IS provided, label each scorecard value with its source (`Field (CrUX)`, `Lab (Lighthouse)`, `Trace (DevTools)`). Field and lab data are not interchangeable: field is what real users experienced, lab is a single synthetic run. Treating them as the same number is a form of fabrication.

Violating this rule is worse than returning no scorecard at all.

## Review Scope

Identify the framework and rendering model (React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, Next.js, Astro, vanilla HTML, etc.) before applying framework-specific checks. Do not recommend `<Image>` from `next/image` to a Vue app, or `React.memo` to a Svelte app.

### 1. Core Web Vitals

- Does the LCP element load within 2.5s? Is it a hero image, heading, or block of text?
- Is the LCP image (if applicable) using `fetchpriority="high"` and not lazy-loaded?
- Are layout shifts caused by images, embeds, ads, fonts, or dynamically injected content?
- Do images, `<source>` elements, iframes, and embeds have explicit `width` and `height` to reserve space?
- Are long tasks (> 50ms) blocking the main thread and delaying INP?
- Are event handlers doing synchronous heavy work before yielding to the browser?
- Is `scheduler.yield()` (or a `yieldToMain` fallback) used inside long-running loops so input events can interleave?
- Is the page using **soft navigation** APIs correctly so INP and LCP are tracked across SPA route changes?
- Is the **Long Animation Frames (LoAF)** API used (or planned) to attribute INP regressions in production?

### 2. Loading

- Is TTFB acceptable (< 800ms)? Are there slow server responses or missing CDN coverage?
- Are critical origins `preconnect`-ed and known third-party origins `dns-prefetch`-ed?
- Are LCP-critical resources preloaded with `fetchpriority="high"`?
- Is the **Speculation Rules API** used to `prerender` or `prefetch` likely-next navigations?
- Are fonts self-hosted, preloaded, and using `font-display: swap` (or `optional` for non-critical)?
- Are fonts subsetted (`unicode-range`) and limited in count/weights?
- Are images in modern formats (WebP, AVIF) with responsive `srcset` and `sizes`?
- Is the initial JavaScript bundle under 200KB gzipped?
- Is code splitting applied for routes and heavy features?
- Are blocking scripts in `<head>` without `defer` or `async`?
- Are third-party scripts loaded with `async`/`defer` and fronted by a facade when heavy (chat widgets, video embeds)?

### 3. Rendering / JavaScript

- Are there unnecessary full-page re-renders? Is state lifted (or colocated) correctly?
- Are long lists virtualized?
- Are animations using `transform` and `opacity` (compositor-only)?
- Is there layout thrashing (reading layout properties, then writing, in a loop)?
- Is `content-visibility: auto` used for off-screen sections?
- Is the **View Transitions API** used appropriately to avoid perceived CLS on SPA navigations?
- Is **bfcache** preserved? (No `unload` handlers, no `Cache-Control: no-store` on HTML)
- **AI-generated patterns:**
  - State duplication instead of lifting state.
  - `React.memo` / `useMemo` / `useCallback` wrapping everything "just in case" (cost without benefit; can hurt perf).
  - Over-eager `useEffect` dependencies causing redundant re-renders or update loops.
  - **Vue:** watchers (`watch`/`watchEffect`) with broad dependencies that trigger unnecessary updates; `computed` with side effects.
  - **Angular:** `ChangeDetectionStrategy.Default` where `OnPush` would suffice; subscriptions without `takeUntil`/`async pipe` that accumulate listeners.
  - **Svelte:** `$:` blocks with expensive logic that re-runs more than needed.
  - **Vanilla:** `scroll`/`resize` listeners without `passive: true` or debounce; DOM manipulation inside a loop that forces repeated reflow.

### 4. Network

- Are static assets cached with long `max-age` + content hashing?
- Is HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 enabled?
- Are there unnecessary redirects?
- Are API responses paginated? Any `SELECT *` or unbounded fetch patterns?
- Are bulk operations used instead of loops of individual API calls?
- Is response compression enabled (gzip/brotli)?
- **AI-generated patterns:**
  - Over-fetching data "just in case."
  - Sequential `await`s when `Promise.all` (or parallel `fetch`) would work.
  - Redundant API calls where one would suffice; missing deduplication on parallel requests.

## Severity Classification

| Severity | Criteria | Action |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **Critical** | Directly causes a Core Web Vital to fail the "Good" threshold | Fix before release |
| **High** | Likely degrades a CWV or causes significant loading/interaction slowdown | Fix before release |
| **Medium** | Suboptimal pattern with measurable but contained impact | Fix in current sprint |
| **Low** | Best practice gap with minor or speculative impact | Schedule for next sprint |
| **Info** | Improvement opportunity with no current evidence of impact | Consider adopting |

## Output Format

```markdown
## Web Performance Audit

### Scorecard

| Metric | Value | Source | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| LCP | [value or "not measured"] | [Field (CrUX) / Lab (Lighthouse) / Trace (DevTools) / —] | ≤ 2.5s | [Good / Needs Work / Poor / —] |
| INP | [value or "not measured"] | [Field (CrUX) / Lab (Lighthouse) / Trace (DevTools) / —] | ≤ 200ms | [Good / Needs Work / Poor / —] |
| CLS | [value or "not measured"] | [Field (CrUX) / Lab (Lighthouse) / Trace (DevTools) / —] | ≤ 0.1 | [Good / Needs Work / Poor / —] |
| Lighthouse Performance | [score or "not measured"] | [Lab (Lighthouse) / —] | ≥ 90 | [Pass / Fail / —] |

> Artifacts used: [list each: Lighthouse report `path/file.json`, CrUX API response, DevTools trace, live MCP capture, or **none — source analysis only**]
> Framework / stack detected: [Next.js 14 App Router / React 18 + Vite / vanilla HTML / etc.]

### Summary
- Critical: [count]
- High: [count]
- Medium: [count]
- Low: [count]

### Findings

#### [CRITICAL] [Finding title]
- **Area:** Core Web Vitals / Loading / Rendering / Network
- **Location:** [file:line or component, or URL when from live capture]
- **Description:** [What the issue is]
- **Impact:** [potential impact / measured: e.g. "+1.2s LCP regression on mobile p75"]
- **Recommendation:** [Specific fix with a small code example when applicable]

#### [HIGH] [Finding title]
...

### Positive Observations
- [Performance practices done well]

### Recommendations
- [Proactive improvements to consider]
```

## Rules

1. Lead with the scorecard. If not measured, say so explicitly before listing findings.
2. Always label scorecard values with their source. Never present lab values as field values or vice versa.
3. Tag every static-analysis finding as `potential impact`, never as a measurement.
4. Identify the framework / stack before recommending framework-specific patterns. Do not recommend idioms from a stack the project does not use.
5. Every finding must include a specific, actionable recommendation.
6. Do not recommend micro-optimizations without evidence they affect a Core Web Vital or another measurable metric.
7. Acknowledge good performance practices — positive reinforcement matters.
8. Use `references/performance-checklist.md` as the minimum baseline for each area.
9. Delegate granular optimization guidance and remediation steps to `skills/performance-optimization/SKILL.md` — keep this report at the audit level.
10. Fold AI-generated anti-patterns into their relevant area (Network or Rendering/JS); do not create a separate "AI" category.
11. In Deep mode, always state which artifacts were provided and which fields remain unmeasured.

# Using agent-skills with Antigravity CLI (agy)

The `agent-skills` package can be installed as a native plugin in the Antigravity CLI (`agy`), giving the agent access to structured workflows, personas, and custom slash commands.

## Setup

### Option 1: Native Plugin Installation (Recommended)

Antigravity CLI has a first-class plugin system that registers skills, agents, and custom commands.

**Install from the remote repository:**

```bash
agy plugin install https://github.com/addyosmani/agent-skills.git
```

**Install from a local clone:**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/addyosmani/agent-skills.git
   ```
2. Install the plugin using `agy`:
   ```bash
   agy plugin install /path/to/agent-skills
   ```

This will validate the plugin and install it into your global Antigravity configuration directory (`~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/plugins/agent-skills/`).

### Option 2: Import from Gemini CLI

If you have already installed `agent-skills` under your legacy Gemini CLI installation, you can import it directly:
```bash
agy plugin import gemini
```

Once installed, verify the active plugin:
```bash
agy plugin list
```

---

## Slash Commands

The plugin registers 8 custom slash commands: 7 lifecycle commands plus the `/webperf` specialist audit:

| Command | What it does | Activated Skill |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| `/spec` | Write a structured spec before writing code | `spec-driven-development` |
| `/planning` | Break work into small, verifiable tasks | `planning-and-task-breakdown` |
| `/build` | Implement the next task incrementally | `incremental-implementation` |
| `/test` | Run TDD workflow — red, green, refactor | `test-driven-development` |
| `/review` | Five-axis code review | `code-review-and-quality` |
| `/code-simplify` | Reduce complexity without changing behavior | `code-simplification` |
| `/ship` | Pre-launch checklist via parallel persona fan-out | `shipping-and-launch` |
| `/webperf` | Audit browser-facing apps for Core Web Vitals and performance issues | `web-performance-auditor` |

Each command automatically invokes the corresponding skill and guides the agent step-by-step.

> **Note:** Use `/planning` instead of `/plan` to avoid conflicts with Antigravity's internal plan-generation command.

---

## Skills & Discovery

Antigravity automatically discovers skills inside the plugin's `skills/` directory. 
* Antigravity matches user tasks and intents to relevant skills on-demand.
* If a task matches a skill, the agent will load the skill and prompt you for permission before executing.

---

## Verification & Validation

To validate that your local plugin is correctly structured and contains all skills, run:
```bash
agy plugin validate /path/to/agent-skills
```

---

## How It Works

### 1. On-Demand Skill Activation
Antigravity CLI automatically discovers the `SKILL.md` files located in the `skills/` directory of the installed plugin. Using the trigger descriptions in each skill's frontmatter, the agent will dynamically activate the appropriate workflow when it detects matching developer intent.

For example, when you ask the agent to:
- **Design a new system** &rarr; It will suggest/activate `spec-driven-development`.
- **Implement a feature** &rarr; It will activate `incremental-implementation` and `test-driven-development`.
- **Fix a bug** &rarr; It will activate `debugging-and-error-recovery`.

### 2. Specialized Agent Personas
The plugin registers reusable subagent definitions from the `agents/` directory:
- `code-reviewer.md`
- `security-auditor.md`
- `test-engineer.md`

You can invoke these personas directly within your session or when delegating tasks using subagents.

---

## Configuration & Customization

### Project-Specific Enforcements (`AGENTS.md`)
To enforce strict skill compliance (e.g. requiring a spec or plan before writing code), copy or link `AGENTS.md` into the root of your workspace. Antigravity CLI reads this file to align the agent's behavior and planning phase with your team's conventions.

### Sandbox Mode
If you want to run skills or scripts with limited terminal permissions (for safety when running third-party validation tests), launch the CLI with:

```bash
agy --sandbox
```

---

## Usage Tips

1. **Keep plugins up-to-date:** You can update the CLI or check for newer plugin versions using:
   ```bash
   agy update
   ```
2. **Review before execution:** When agents execute complex refactoring tasks using these skills, use `Ctrl+r` to enter the **Artifact Review** screen to review, edit, or approve code before it is committed.
3. **Control permissions:** You can use the `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag only in trusted local projects where you want to bypass manual tool approval prompts.

# Using agent-skills with GitHub Copilot

## Setup

### Copilot Instructions

Copilot supports creating agent skills using a `.github/skills`, `.claude/skills`, or `.agents/skills` directory in your repository.

```bash
mkdir -p .github

# Create files for essential skills
cat /path/to/agent-skills/skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md > .github/skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md
cat /path/to/agent-skills/skills/code-review-and-quality/SKILL.md > .github/skills/code-review-and-quality/SKILL.md
```

For more details, refer [Creating agent skills for GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent/create-skills).

### Agent Personas (*.agent.md)

Copilot supports specialized agent personas. Use the agent-skills agents:

> **Important:** GitHub Copilot requires custom agent files to be named `*.agent.md`.
> Files named `*.md` are silently ignored by Copilot.
> See [VS Code custom agents docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/custom-agents#_custom-agent-file-structure) for details.

```bash
# Create the agents directory and copy agent definitions
mkdir -p .github/agents
cp /path/to/agent-skills/agents/code-reviewer.md .github/agents/code-reviewer.agent.md
cp /path/to/agent-skills/agents/test-engineer.md .github/agents/test-engineer.agent.md
cp /path/to/agent-skills/agents/security-auditor.md .github/agents/security-auditor.agent.md
```

Invoke agents in Copilot Chat:
- `@code-reviewer Review this PR`
- `@test-engineer Analyze test coverage for this module`
- `@security-auditor Check this endpoint for vulnerabilities`

### Custom Instructions (User Level)

For skills you want across all repositories:

1. Open VS Code → Settings → GitHub Copilot → Custom Instructions
2. Add your most-used skill summaries

## Recommended Configuration

### .github/copilot-instructions.md

GitHub Copilot supports project-level instructions via `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

```markdown
# Project Coding Standards

## Testing
- Write tests before code (TDD)
- For bugs: write a failing test first, then fix (Prove-It pattern)
- Test hierarchy: unit > integration > e2e (use the lowest level that captures the behavior)
- Run `npm test` after every change

## Code Quality
- Review across five axes: correctness, readability, architecture, security, performance
- Every PR must pass: lint, type check, tests, build
- No secrets in code or version control

## Implementation
- Build in small, verifiable increments
- Each increment: implement → test → verify → commit
- Never mix formatting changes with behavior changes

## Boundaries
- Always: Run tests before commits, validate user input
- Ask first: Database schema changes, new dependencies
- Never: Commit secrets, remove failing tests, skip verification
```

### Specialized Agents

Use the agents for targeted review workflows in Copilot Chat.

## Usage Tips

1. **Keep instructions concise** — Copilot instructions work best when focused. Summarize the key rules rather than including full skill files.
2. **Use agents for review** — The code-reviewer, test-engineer, and security-auditor agents are designed for Copilot's agent model.
3. **Reference in chat** — When working on a specific phase, paste the relevant skill content into Copilot Chat for context.
4. **Combine with PR reviews** — Set up Copilot to review PRs using the code-reviewer agent persona.


===== FILE: /root/web-archive/ai_agents_skills_library/0-platform-precursor-systems/imported/addyosmani-agent-skills/docs/cursor-setup.md =====

# Using agent-skills with Cursor

## Setup

### Option 1: Rules Directory (Recommended)

Cursor supports a `.cursor/rules/` directory for project-specific rules:

```bash
# Create the rules directory
mkdir -p .cursor/rules

# Copy skills you want as rules
cp /path/to/agent-skills/skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md .cursor/rules/test-driven-development.md
cp /path/to/agent-skills/skills/code-review-and-quality/SKILL.md .cursor/rules/code-review-and-quality.md
cp /path/to/agent-skills/skills/incremental-implementation/SKILL.md .cursor/rules/incremental-implementation.md
```

Rules in this directory are automatically loaded into Cursor's context.

### Option 2: .cursorrules File

Create a `.cursorrules` file in your project root with the essential skills inlined:

```bash
# Generate a combined rules file
cat /path/to/agent-skills/skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md > .cursorrules
echo "\n---\n" >> .cursorrules
cat /path/to/agent-skills/skills/code-review-and-quality/SKILL.md >> .cursorrules
```

## Recommended Configuration

### Essential Skills (Always Load)

Add these to `.cursor/rules/`:

1. `test-driven-development.md` — TDD workflow and Prove-It pattern
2. `code-review-and-quality.md` — Five-axis review
3. `incremental-implementation.md` — Build in small verifiable slices

### Phase-Specific Skills (Load on Demand)

For phase-specific work, create additional rule files as needed:

- `spec-development.md` -> `spec-driven-development/SKILL.md`
- `frontend-ui.md` -> `frontend-ui-engineering/SKILL.md`
- `security.md` -> `security-and-hardening/SKILL.md`
- `performance.md` -> `performance-optimization/SKILL.md`

Add these to `.cursor/rules/` when working on relevant tasks, then remove when done to manage context limits.

## Usage Tips

1. **Don't load all skills at once** - Cursor has context limits. Load 2-3 essential skills as rules and add phase-specific skills as needed.
2. **Reference skills explicitly** - Tell Cursor "Follow the test-driven-development rules for this change" to ensure it reads the loaded rules.
3. **Use agents for review** - Copy `agents/code-reviewer.md` content and tell Cursor to "review this diff using this code review framework."
4. **Load references on demand** - When working on performance, add `performance.md` to `.cursor/rules/` or paste the checklist content directly.


===== FILE: /root/web-archive/ai_agents_skills_library/0-platform-precursor-systems/imported/addyosmani-agent-skills/docs/gemini-cli-setup.md =====

# Using agent-skills with Gemini CLI

## Setup

### Option 1: Install as Skills (Recommended)

Gemini CLI has a native skills system that auto-discovers `SKILL.md` files in `.gemini/skills/` or `.agents/skills/` directories. Each skill activates on demand when it matches your task.

**Install from the repo:**

```bash
gemini skills install https://github.com/addyosmani/agent-skills.git --path skills
```

**Or install from a local clone:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/addyosmani/agent-skills.git
gemini skills install /path/to/agent-skills/skills/
```

**Install for a specific workspace only:**

```bash
gemini skills install /path/to/agent-skills/skills/ --scope workspace
```

Skills installed at workspace scope go into `.gemini/skills/` (or `.agents/skills/`). User-level skills go into `~/.gemini/skills/`.

Once installed, verify with:

```
/skills list
```

Gemini CLI injects skill names and descriptions into the prompt automatically. When it recognizes a matching task, it asks permission to activate the skill before loading its full instructions.

### Option 2: GEMINI.md (Persistent Context)

For skills you want always loaded as persistent project context (rather than on-demand activation), add them to your project's `GEMINI.md`:

```bash
# Create GEMINI.md with core skills as persistent context
cat /path/to/agent-skills/skills/incremental-implementation/SKILL.md > GEMINI.md
echo -e "\n---\n" >> GEMINI.md
cat /path/to/agent-skills/skills/code-review-and-quality/SKILL.md >> GEMINI.md
```

You can also modularize by importing from separate files:

```markdown
# Project Instructions

@skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md
@skills/incremental-implementation/SKILL.md
```

Use `/memory show` to verify loaded context, and `/memory reload` to refresh after changes.

> **Skills vs GEMINI.md:** Skills are on-demand expertise that activate only when relevant, keeping your context window clean. GEMINI.md provides persistent context loaded for every prompt. Use skills for phase-specific workflows and GEMINI.md for always-on project conventions.

## Recommended Configuration

### Always-On (GEMINI.md)

Add these as persistent context for every session:

- `incremental-implementation` — Build in small verifiable slices
- `code-review-and-quality` — Five-axis review

### On-Demand (Skills)

Install these as skills so they activate only when relevant:

- `test-driven-development` — Activates when implementing logic or fixing bugs
- `spec-driven-development` — Activates when starting a new project or feature
- `frontend-ui-engineering` — Activates when building UI
- `security-and-hardening` — Activates during security reviews
- `performance-optimization` — Activates during performance work

## Advanced Configuration

### MCP Integration

Many skills in this pack leverage [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) tools to interact with the environment. For example:

- `browser-testing-with-devtools` uses the `chrome-devtools` MCP extension.
- `performance-optimization` can benefit from performance-related MCP tools.

To enable these, ensure you have the relevant MCP extensions installed in your Gemini CLI configuration (`~/.gemini/config.json`).

### Session Hooks

Gemini CLI supports session lifecycle hooks. You can use these to automatically inject context or run validation scripts at the start of a session.

To replicate the `agent-skills` experience from other tools, you can configure a `SessionStart` hook that reminds you of the available skills or loads a meta-skill.

### Explicit Context Loading

You can explicitly load any skill into your current session by referencing it with the `@` symbol in your prompt:

```markdown
Use the @skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md skill to implement this fix.
```

This is useful when you want to ensure a specific workflow is followed without waiting for auto-discovery.

## Slash Commands

The repo ships 8 slash commands under `.gemini/commands/`: 7 lifecycle commands plus the `/webperf` specialist audit. Gemini CLI auto-discovers them when you run from the project root.

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/spec` | Write a structured spec before writing code |
| `/planning` | Break work into small, verifiable tasks |
| `/build` | Implement the next task incrementally |
| `/test` | Run TDD workflow — red, green, refactor |
| `/review` | Five-axis code review |
| `/code-simplify` | Reduce complexity without changing behavior |
| `/ship` | Pre-launch checklist via parallel persona fan-out |
| `/webperf` | Audit browser-facing apps for Core Web Vitals and performance issues |

Each command invokes the corresponding skill automatically — no manual skill loading required.

> **Note:** Use `/planning` instead of `/plan` — `/plan` conflicts with a Gemini CLI internal command name.

## Usage Tips

1. **Prefer skills over GEMINI.md** — Skills activate on demand and keep your context window focused. Only put skills in GEMINI.md if you want them always loaded.
2. **Skill descriptions matter** — Each SKILL.md has a `description` field in its frontmatter that tells agents when to activate it. The descriptions in this repo are optimized for auto-discovery across all supported tools (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, etc.) by clearly stating both *what* the skill does and *when* it should be triggered.
3. **Use agents for review** — Copy `agents/code-reviewer.md` content when requesting structured code reviews.
4. **Combine with references** — Reference checklists from `references/` when working on specific quality areas like testing or performance.

# Getting Started with agent-skills

agent-skills works with any AI coding agent that accepts Markdown instructions. This guide covers the universal approach. For tool-specific setup, see the dedicated guides.

## How Skills Work

Each skill is a Markdown file (`SKILL.md`) that describes a specific engineering workflow. When loaded into an agent's context, the agent follows the workflow — including verification steps, anti-patterns to avoid, and exit criteria.

**Skills are not reference docs.** They're step-by-step processes the agent follows.

## Quick Start (Any Agent)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/addyosmani/agent-skills.git
```

### 2. Choose a skill

Browse the `skills/` directory. Each subdirectory contains a `SKILL.md` with:
- **When to use** — triggers that indicate this skill applies
- **Process** — step-by-step workflow
- **Verification** — how to confirm the work is done
- **Common rationalizations** — excuses the agent might use to skip steps
- **Red flags** — signs the skill is being violated

### 3. Load the skill into your agent

Copy the relevant `SKILL.md` content into your agent's system prompt, rules file, or conversation. The most common approaches:

**System prompt:** Paste the skill content at the start of the session.

**Rules file:** Add skill content to your project's rules file (CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules, etc.).

**Conversation:** Reference the skill when giving instructions: "Follow the test-driven-development process for this change."

### 4. Use the meta-skill for discovery

Start with the `using-agent-skills` skill loaded. It contains a flowchart that maps task types to the appropriate skill.

## Recommended Setup

### Minimal (Start here)

Load three essential skills into your rules file:

1. **spec-driven-development** — For defining what to build
2. **test-driven-development** — For proving it works
3. **code-review-and-quality** — For verifying quality before merge

These three cover the most critical quality gaps in AI-assisted development.

### Full Lifecycle

For comprehensive coverage, load skills by phase:

```
Starting a project:  spec-driven-development → planning-and-task-breakdown
During development:  incremental-implementation + test-driven-development
Before merge:        code-review-and-quality + security-and-hardening
Before deploy:       shipping-and-launch
```

### Context-Aware Loading

Don't load all skills at once — it wastes context. Load skills relevant to the current task:

- Working on UI? Load `frontend-ui-engineering`
- Debugging? Load `debugging-and-error-recovery`
- Setting up CI? Load `ci-cd-and-automation`

## Skill Anatomy

Every skill follows the same structure:

```
YAML frontmatter (name, description)
├── Overview — What this skill does
├── When to Use — Triggers and conditions
├── Core Process — Step-by-step workflow
├── Examples — Code samples and patterns
├── Common Rationalizations — Excuses and rebuttals
├── Red Flags — Signs the skill is being violated
└── Verification — Exit criteria checklist
```

See [skill-anatomy.md](skill-anatomy.md) for the full specification.

## Using Agents

The `agents/` directory contains pre-configured agent personas:

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `code-reviewer.md` | Five-axis code review |
| `test-engineer.md` | Test strategy and writing |
| `security-auditor.md` | Vulnerability detection |
| `web-performance-auditor.md` | Core Web Vitals & performance audit (via `/webperf`) |

Load an agent definition when you need specialized review. For example, ask your coding agent to "review this change using the code-reviewer agent persona" and provide the agent definition.

## Using Commands

The `.claude/commands/` directory contains slash commands for Claude Code:

| Command | Skill Invoked |
|---------|---------------|
| `/spec` | spec-driven-development |
| `/plan` | planning-and-task-breakdown |
| `/build` | incremental-implementation + test-driven-development |
| `/build auto` | planning-and-task-breakdown → incremental-implementation + test-driven-development (whole plan, one approval) |
| `/test` | test-driven-development |
| `/review` | code-review-and-quality |
| `/code-simplify` | code-simplification |
| `/ship` | shipping-and-launch |
| `/webperf` | web-performance-auditor (specialist agent, web apps only) |

## Using References

The `references/` directory contains supplementary checklists:

| Reference | Use With |
|-----------|----------|
| `testing-patterns.md` | test-driven-development |
| `performance-checklist.md` | performance-optimization |
| `security-checklist.md` | security-and-hardening |
| `accessibility-checklist.md` | frontend-ui-engineering |

Load a reference when you need detailed patterns beyond what the skill covers.

## Spec and task artifacts

The `/spec` and `/plan` commands create working artifacts (`SPEC.md`, `tasks/plan.md`, `tasks/todo.md`). Treat them as **living documents** while the work is in progress:

- Keep them in version control during development so the human and the agent have a shared source of truth.
- Update them when scope or decisions change.
- If your repo doesn’t want these files long‑term, delete them before merge or add the folder to `.gitignore` — the workflow doesn’t require them to be permanent.

## Tips

1. **Start with spec-driven-development** for any non-trivial work
2. **Always load test-driven-development** when writing code
3. **Don't skip verification steps** — they're the whole point
4. **Load skills selectively** — more context isn't always better
5. **Use the agents for review** — different perspectives catch different issues

# OpenCode Setup

This guide explains how to use Agent Skills with OpenCode in a way that closely mirrors the Claude Code experience (automatic skill selection, lifecycle-driven workflows, and strict process enforcement).

## Overview

OpenCode supports custom `/commands`, but does not have a native plugin system or automatic skill routing like Claude Code.

Instead, we achieve parity through:

- A strong system prompt (`AGENTS.md`)
- The built-in `skill` tool
- Consistent skill discovery from the `/skills` directory

This creates an **agent-driven workflow** where skills are selected and executed automatically.

While it is possible to recreate `/spec`, `/plan`, and other commands in OpenCode, this integration intentionally uses an agent-driven approach instead:

- Skills are selected automatically based on intent
- Workflows are enforced via `AGENTS.md`
- No manual command invocation is required

This more closely matches how Claude Code behaves in practice, where skills are triggered automatically rather than manually.

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/addyosmani/agent-skills.git
```

2. Open the project in OpenCode.

3. Ensure the following files are present in your workspace:

- `AGENTS.md` (root)
- `skills/` directory

No additional installation is required.

---

## How It Works

### 1. Skill Discovery

All skills live in:

```
skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
```

OpenCode agents are instructed (via `AGENTS.md`) to:

- Detect when a skill applies
- Invoke the `skill` tool
- Follow the skill exactly

### 2. Automatic Skill Invocation

The agent evaluates every request and maps it to the appropriate skill.

Examples:

- "build a feature" → `incremental-implementation` + `test-driven-development`
- "design a system" → `spec-driven-development`
- "fix a bug" → `debugging-and-error-recovery`
- "review this code" → `code-review-and-quality`

The user does **not** need to explicitly request skills.

### 3. Lifecycle Mapping (Implicit Commands)

The development lifecycle is encoded implicitly:

- DEFINE → `spec-driven-development`
- PLAN → `planning-and-task-breakdown`
- BUILD → `incremental-implementation` + `test-driven-development`
- VERIFY → `debugging-and-error-recovery`
- REVIEW → `code-review-and-quality`
- SHIP → `shipping-and-launch`

This replaces slash commands like `/spec`, `/plan`, etc.

---

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Feature Development

User:
```
Add authentication to this app
```

Agent behavior:
- Detects feature work
- Invokes `spec-driven-development`
- Produces a spec before writing code
- Moves to planning and implementation skills

---

### Example 2: Bug Fix

User:
```
This endpoint is returning 500 errors
```

Agent behavior:
- Invokes `debugging-and-error-recovery`
- Reproduces → localizes → fixes → adds guards

---

### Example 3: Code Review

User:
```
Review this PR
```

Agent behavior:
- Invokes `code-review-and-quality`
- Applies structured review (correctness, design, readability, etc.)

---

## Agent Expectations (Critical)

For OpenCode to work correctly, the agent must follow these rules:

- Always check if a skill applies before acting
- If a skill applies, it MUST be used
- Never skip required workflows (spec, plan, test, etc.)
- Do not jump directly to implementation

These rules are enforced via `AGENTS.md`.

---

## Limitations

- No native slash commands (handled via intent mapping instead)
- No plugin system (handled via prompt + structure)
- Skill invocation depends on model compliance

Despite these, the workflow closely matches Claude Code in practice.

---

## Recommended Workflow

Just use natural language:

- "Design a feature"
- "Plan this change"
- "Implement this"
- "Fix this bug"
- "Review this"

The agent will automatically select and execute the correct skills.

---

## Summary

OpenCode integration works by combining:

- Structured skills (this repo)
- Strong agent rules (`AGENTS.md`)
- Automatic skill invocation via reasoning

This results in a **fully agent-driven, production-grade engineering workflow** without requiring plugins or manual commands.

# Skill Anatomy

This document describes the structure and format of agent-skills skill files. Use this as a guide when contributing new skills or understanding existing ones.

## File Location

Every skill lives in its own directory under `skills/`:

```
skills/
  skill-name/
    SKILL.md           # Required: The skill definition
    scripts/           # Optional: Runnable helpers used by the skill workflow
    supporting-file.md # Optional: Reference material loaded on demand
```

`SKILL.md` is the only required file. Add `scripts/` only when the skill actually ships runnable helpers, and omit the directory entirely for markdown-only skills.

## SKILL.md Format

### Frontmatter (Required)

```yaml
---
name: skill-name-with-hyphens
description: Guides agents through [task/workflow]. Use when [specific trigger conditions].
---
```

**Rules:**
- `name`: Lowercase, hyphen-separated. Must match the directory name.
- `description`: Start with what the skill does in third person, then include one or more clear "Use when" trigger conditions. Include both *what* and *when*. Maximum 1024 characters.

**Why this matters:** Agents discover skills by reading descriptions. The description is injected into the system prompt, so it must tell the agent both what the skill provides and when to activate it. Do not summarize the workflow — if the description contains process steps, the agent may follow the summary instead of reading the full skill.

### Standard Sections (Recommended Pattern)

The frontmatter contract above is required. The section layout below is a recommended pattern, not a rigid template: equivalent headings are acceptable when they serve the same purpose clearly.

```markdown
# Skill Title

## Overview
One-two sentences explaining what this skill does and why it matters.

## When to Use
- Bullet list of triggering conditions (symptoms, task types)
- When NOT to use (exclusions)

## [Core Process / The Workflow / Steps]
The main workflow, broken into numbered steps or phases.
Include code examples where they help.
Use flowcharts (ASCII) where decision points exist.

## [Specific Techniques / Patterns]
Detailed guidance for specific scenarios.
Code examples, templates, configuration.

## Common Rationalizations
| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| Excuse agents use to skip steps | Why the excuse is wrong |

## Red Flags
- Behavioral patterns indicating the skill is being violated
- Things to watch for during review

## Verification
After completing the skill's process, confirm:
- [ ] Checklist of exit criteria
- [ ] Evidence requirements
```

## Section Purposes

### Overview
The "elevator pitch" for the skill. Should answer: What does this skill do, and why should an agent follow it?

### When to Use
Helps agents and humans decide if this skill applies to the current task. Include both positive triggers ("Use when X") and negative exclusions ("NOT for Y").

### Core Process
The heart of the skill. This is the step-by-step workflow the agent follows. Must be specific and actionable — not vague advice.

**Good:** "Run `npm test` and verify all tests pass"
**Bad:** "Make sure the tests work"

### Common Rationalizations
The most distinctive feature of well-crafted skills. These are excuses agents use to skip important steps, paired with rebuttals. They prevent the agent from rationalizing its way out of following the process.

Think of every time an agent has said "I'll add tests later" or "This is simple enough to skip the spec" — those go here with a factual counter-argument.

### Red Flags
Observable signs that the skill is being violated. Useful during code review and self-monitoring.

### Verification
The exit criteria. A checklist the agent uses to confirm the skill's process is complete. Every checkbox should be verifiable with evidence (test output, build result, screenshot, etc.).

## Supporting Files

Create supporting files only when:
- Reference material exceeds 100 lines (keep the main SKILL.md focused)
- Code tools or scripts are needed
- Checklists are long enough to justify separate files

Keep patterns and principles inline when under 50 lines.

If a skill does not need runnable helpers, do not create an empty `scripts/` directory just to mirror other skills. Empty directories add noise without changing how the skill works.

## Writing Principles

1. **Process over knowledge.** Skills are workflows, not reference docs. Steps, not facts.
2. **Specific over general.** "Run `npm test`" beats "verify the tests".
3. **Evidence over assumption.** Every verification checkbox requires proof.
4. **Anti-rationalization.** Every skip-worthy step needs a counter-argument in the rationalizations table.
5. **Progressive disclosure.** Main SKILL.md is the entry point. Supporting files are loaded only when needed.
6. **Token-conscious.** Every section must justify its inclusion. If removing it wouldn't change agent behavior, remove it.

## Naming Conventions

- Skill directories: `lowercase-hyphen-separated`
- Skill files: `SKILL.md` (always uppercase)
- Supporting files: `lowercase-hyphen-separated.md`
- References: stored in `references/` at the project root, not inside skill directories

## Cross-Skill References

Reference other skills by name:

```markdown
Follow the `test-driven-development` skill for writing tests.
If the build breaks, use the `debugging-and-error-recovery` skill.
```

Don't duplicate content between skills — reference and link instead.

## Required vs Recommended

Required:

- A `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` file
- Valid YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`
- A description that includes both what the skill does and when to use it

Recommended:

- The standard section flow shown above
- Equivalent headings such as `How It Works`, `Core Process`, or `Workflow` when they read more naturally for the skill
- Supporting files only when they keep the main `SKILL.md` focused

# Using agent-skills with Windsurf

## Setup

### Project Rules

Windsurf uses `.windsurfrules` for project-specific agent instructions:

```bash
# Create a combined rules file from your most important skills
cat /path/to/agent-skills/skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md > .windsurfrules
echo "\n---\n" >> .windsurfrules
cat /path/to/agent-skills/skills/incremental-implementation/SKILL.md >> .windsurfrules
echo "\n---\n" >> .windsurfrules
cat /path/to/agent-skills/skills/code-review-and-quality/SKILL.md >> .windsurfrules
```

### Global Rules

For skills you want across all projects, add them to Windsurf's global rules:

1. Open Windsurf → Settings → AI → Global Rules
2. Paste the content of your most-used skills

## Recommended Configuration

Keep `.windsurfrules` focused on 2-3 essential skills to stay within context limits:

```
# .windsurfrules
# Essential agent-skills for this project

[Paste test-driven-development SKILL.md]

---

[Paste incremental-implementation SKILL.md]

---

[Paste code-review-and-quality SKILL.md]
```

## Usage Tips

1. **Be selective** — Windsurf's context is limited. Choose skills that address your biggest quality gaps.
2. **Reference in conversation** — Paste additional skill content into the chat when working on specific phases (e.g., paste `security-and-hardening` when building auth).
3. **Use references as checklists** — Paste `references/security-checklist.md` and ask Windsurf to verify each item.


===== FILE: /root/web-archive/ai_agents_skills_library/0-platform-precursor-systems/imported/addyosmani-agent-skills/hooks/SDD-CACHE.md =====

# sdd-cache hook

Cross-session citation cache for [`source-driven-development`](../skills/source-driven-development/SKILL.md). Skips redundant `WebFetch` calls without weakening the skill's "verify against current docs" guarantee.

## Why

`source-driven-development` fetches official docs for every framework-specific decision. Working on the same project across sessions means fetching the same pages over and over. Caching the content as local memory would contradict the skill — docs change, and a stale cache hides that.

This hook caches fetched content on disk, but **revalidates with the origin server on every reuse** via HTTP `If-None-Match` / `If-Modified-Since`. Content is only served from cache when the server responds `304 Not Modified`, which is a fresh verification — not a memory read.

## Setup

1. Add hooks to `.claude/settings.json` (or `.claude/settings.local.json` for personal use):

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "WebFetch",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash ${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/hooks/sdd-cache-pre.sh",
            "timeout": 10
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "WebFetch",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash ${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/hooks/sdd-cache-post.sh",
            "async": true,
            "timeout": 10
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

   `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}` resolves to the directory you launched Claude Code from. The snippet above works when the hooks live inside the same project. If you installed `agent-skills` elsewhere (e.g. as a shared plugin under `~/agent-skills`), replace `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/hooks/...` with the absolute path to each script.

2. Make sure `.claude/sdd-cache/` is in your `.gitignore` (already included in this repo).

3. Use `/source-driven-development` (or the skill) as usual. No changes to the skill or the agent's workflow — the cache is transparent.

## Mental model

HTTP resource cache keyed by URL. Freshness is delegated to the origin via `ETag` / `Last-Modified`; no TTL, no prompt in the key.

The stored body is not raw HTML — `WebFetch` post-processes each response through a model using the caller's prompt, so what we cache is one agent's reading of the page. The key stays URL-only so reads reuse across sessions; the original prompt is kept as metadata and surfaced in the hit message so the next agent can tell whether the earlier reading fits.

## How it works

One cache entry per URL, stored as JSON in `.claude/sdd-cache/<sha>.json`:

| Event | Action |
|---|---|
| `PreToolUse WebFetch` | If an entry exists, sends a `HEAD` request with `If-None-Match` / `If-Modified-Since`. On `304`, blocks the fetch and returns the cached content to the agent via stderr, with the original prompt surfaced as metadata. Otherwise allows the fetch. |
| `PostToolUse WebFetch` | Captures the response, issues a `HEAD` request to record the current `ETag` / `Last-Modified`, and stores `{url, prompt, etag, last_modified, content, fetched_at}`. |

**Freshness rules:**

- Entry is served only if the origin confirms `304 Not Modified`.
- Entries without an `ETag` or `Last-Modified` header are never cached — without a validator, the hook cannot verify freshness later, and caching would mean trusting memory.
- Cache key is `sha256(url)`. The same URL asked with a different prompt hits the same entry; the cached body reflects the prompt used on the first fetch, and that prompt is shown alongside the hit so the agent can decide whether to re-use or re-fetch manually.

**What the agent sees:**

- Cache hit: `WebFetch` is blocked via exit code 2. Claude Code delivers the hook's stderr payload back to the agent as a tool error — this is the intended signal for a cache hit, not a failure. The payload is prefixed with `[sdd-cache] Cache hit for <url>` and wraps the cached body between `----- BEGIN CACHED CONTENT -----` / `----- END CACHED CONTENT -----` markers so the agent can use it as if `WebFetch` had just returned it.
- Cache miss or stale: `WebFetch` runs normally; the result is stored for next time.

The skill itself is unchanged. It continues to follow `DETECT → FETCH → IMPLEMENT → CITE`. The hook only changes what happens under the hood when `FETCH` runs.

## Local testing

### 1. Smoke test the scripts directly

```bash
# Simulate a PostToolUse payload: cache a page
echo '{
  "tool_input": {
    "url": "https://react.dev/reference/react/useActionState",
    "prompt": "extract the signature"
  },
  "tool_response": "useActionState(action, initialState) returns [state, formAction, isPending]"
}' | bash hooks/sdd-cache-post.sh

# Inspect the stored entry
ls .claude/sdd-cache/
cat .claude/sdd-cache/*.json | jq .

# Simulate the next PreToolUse on the same URL + prompt
echo '{
  "tool_input": {
    "url": "https://react.dev/reference/react/useActionState",
    "prompt": "extract the signature"
  }
}' | bash hooks/sdd-cache-pre.sh
echo "exit=$?"
```

Expected:

- First command creates one file under `.claude/sdd-cache/` (only if the server returned an `ETag` or `Last-Modified`).
- Second command exits `2` with the cached content on stderr when the origin replies `304`, or exits `0` silently otherwise.

### 2. End-to-end in a real session

1. Register the hooks in `.claude/settings.local.json` as shown above.
2. Start a Claude Code session in this repo.
3. Ask the agent to fetch a documentation page (e.g. "fetch `https://react.dev/reference/react/useActionState` and summarize").
4. Verify a file appears under `.claude/sdd-cache/`.
5. Ask the agent to fetch the same page with the same prompt again.
6. Verify the second `WebFetch` is blocked and the cached content is returned (visible in the session transcript as a tool error with `[sdd-cache]` prefix).

### 3. Freshness verification

To confirm the cache invalidates when docs change, force an `ETag` mismatch. Pick one specific entry — `*.json` is unsafe once the cache holds more than one file:

```bash
# Pick the entry you want to corrupt (swap in the actual filename)
ENTRY=.claude/sdd-cache/e49c9f378670cfbb1d7d871b6dee16d9.json

# Patch its ETag to something the origin will not recognize
jq '.etag = "W/\"stale-etag-forced\""' "$ENTRY" > "$ENTRY.tmp" && mv "$ENTRY.tmp" "$ENTRY"

# Next PreToolUse should miss (server returns 200, not 304)
echo '{"tool_input":{"url":"...", "prompt":"..."}}' | bash hooks/sdd-cache-pre.sh
echo "exit=$?"   # expect 0 (fetch allowed through)
```

### 4. Debugging

Both hooks write timestamped events to `.claude/sdd-cache/.debug.log` when debug mode is on. Enable it with either:

```bash
# Option A: env var (per-session)
SDD_CACHE_DEBUG=1 claude

# Option B: sentinel file (persistent)
mkdir -p .claude/sdd-cache && touch .claude/sdd-cache/.debug
# …disable with: rm .claude/sdd-cache/.debug
```

The log captures URL, detected `tool_response` shape, HEAD status, and why each invocation hit or missed. Useful when a cache miss looks unexpected (typically: the origin stopped emitting validators).

## Known limitations

- **Body is prompt-shaped.** A hit returns the earlier agent's reading of the page, with the original prompt surfaced so the current agent can decide whether it applies. If it doesn't, delete the file under `.claude/sdd-cache/` to force a re-fetch.
- **Every cache write costs an extra HEAD.** Claude Code doesn't expose the response headers that `WebFetch` already received, so the post hook re-queries the origin to capture `ETag` / `Last-Modified`. One extra roundtrip per miss — the price of keeping this a pure hook with no core changes.
- **Servers without `ETag` or `Last-Modified` are never cached.** Most official doc sites (react.dev, docs.djangoproject.com, developer.mozilla.org) emit validators. Sites that don't are always re-fetched.
- **A misbehaving server can serve a wrong `304`.** That's a server bug to diagnose, not a cache invariant to defend against; we don't paper over it with a TTL. Delete the entry if you spot a stale one.
- **Cache is local and per-project.** There is no team-wide shared cache. Adding one would require a signed-content-addressable storage layer, which is out of scope.

## Requirements

- `jq`
- `curl`
- `shasum` or `sha256sum` (auto-detected)
- Bash 3.2+


===== FILE: /root/web-archive/ai_agents_skills_library/0-platform-precursor-systems/imported/addyosmani-agent-skills/hooks/SIMPLIFY-IGNORE.md =====

# simplify-ignore hook

Block-level protection for `/code-simplify`. Mark code that should never be simplified — the model won't see it.

## Setup

1. Annotate blocks you want to protect:

```js
/* simplify-ignore-start: perf-critical */
// manually unrolled XOR — 3x faster than a loop
result[0] = buf[0] ^ key[0];
result[1] = buf[1] ^ key[1];
result[2] = buf[2] ^ key[2];
result[3] = buf[3] ^ key[3];
/* simplify-ignore-end */
```

2. Add hooks to `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Read",
        "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "bash ${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/hooks/simplify-ignore.sh" }]
      }
    ],
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|Write",
        "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "bash ${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/hooks/simplify-ignore.sh" }]
      }
    ],
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "bash ${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/hooks/simplify-ignore.sh" }]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

3. Run `/code-simplify` — protected blocks become `/* BLOCK_de115a1d: perf-critical */` placeholders. The model reasons about surrounding code without seeing the protected implementation.

> **Note:** The hook stores temporary backups in `.claude/.simplify-ignore-cache/`. Make sure this path is in your `.gitignore`.

## How it works

One script, three hook events:

| Event | Action |
|---|---|
| `PreToolUse Read` | Backs up file, replaces blocks with `BLOCK_<hash>` placeholders in-place |
| `PostToolUse Edit\|Write` | Expands placeholders back to real code, saves model's changes, re-filters |
| `Stop` | Restores all files from backup when session ends |

Each block is content-hashed (8 hex chars via `shasum`/`sha1sum`) so the round-trip is unambiguous even if the model duplicates or reorders placeholders. Cache is project-scoped to prevent cross-session interference.

## Annotation syntax

```js
/* simplify-ignore-start */           // basic — hides the block
/* simplify-ignore-start: reason */   // with reason — appears in placeholder
/* simplify-ignore-end */
```

Any comment style works (`//`, `/*`, `#`, `<!--`). Multiple blocks per file and single-line blocks supported. Placeholders preserve the original comment syntax (e.g. `# BLOCK_xxx` for Python, `<!-- BLOCK_xxx -->` for HTML).

## Crash recovery

If Claude Code crashes without triggering the Stop hook, files on disk may still have `BLOCK_<hash>` placeholders. To restore manually:

```bash
echo '{}' | bash hooks/simplify-ignore.sh
```

Backups are stored in `.claude/.simplify-ignore-cache/` within your project directory.

## Known limitations

- **Single-line blocks hide the entire line.** If `simplify-ignore-start` and `simplify-ignore-end` appear on the same line as other code, the whole line is hidden from the model, not just the annotated portion. Use dedicated lines for annotations.
- **Comment suffix detection covers `*/` and `-->` only.** Template engines with non-standard comment closers (ERB `%>`, Blade `--}}`) may produce unbalanced placeholders. Use `#` or `//` style comments instead.
- **Fallback expansion is progressive, not exact.** If the model alters a placeholder's formatting (e.g. changes the reason text), the hook tries progressively simpler matches: full placeholder → prefix+hash+suffix → hash-only. The hash-only fallback may leave cosmetic debris (e.g. stray `:` or reason text). A warning is printed to stderr when this happens.
- **File renaming leaves placeholders.** If the model renames or moves a file via a shell command, the new file will retain `BLOCK_<hash>` placeholders. The original code is saved as `<old-filename>.recovered` when the session stops. You must manually restore the recovered code into the new file.

## Requirements

- `jq`, `shasum` or `sha1sum` (auto-detected), Bash 3.2+

## Essential Checks

### Keyboard Navigation
- [ ] All interactive elements focusable via Tab key
- [ ] Focus order follows visual/logical order
- [ ] Focus is visible (outline/ring on focused elements)
- [ ] Custom widgets have keyboard support (Enter to activate, Escape to close)
- [ ] No keyboard traps (user can always Tab away from a component)
- [ ] Skip-to-content link at top of page - visible (at least) on keyboard focus
- [ ] Modals trap focus while open, return focus on close

### Screen Readers
- [ ] All images have `alt` text (or `alt=""` for decorative images)
- [ ] All form inputs have associated labels (`<label>` or `aria-label`)
- [ ] Buttons and links have descriptive text (not "Click here")
- [ ] Icon-only buttons have `aria-label`
- [ ] Page has one `<h1>` and headings don't skip levels
- [ ] Dynamic content changes announced (`aria-live` regions)
- [ ] Tables have `<th>` headers with scope

### Visual
- [ ] Text contrast ≥ 4.5:1 (normal text) or ≥ 3:1 (large text, 18px+)
- [ ] UI components contrast ≥ 3:1 against backg
